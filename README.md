# Simon-Says-A-Game
I have Developed Symon says a game project using HTML CSS and JavaScript, Started with a simple HTML structure — the skeleton of the game.
Used Event handlers to start the game.
Added a heartbeat with a random sequence generator that grows tougher each level.
Used setTimeout functions so every button flashes with perfect timing.
Along with that add tracking the Highest Score of all plays.
